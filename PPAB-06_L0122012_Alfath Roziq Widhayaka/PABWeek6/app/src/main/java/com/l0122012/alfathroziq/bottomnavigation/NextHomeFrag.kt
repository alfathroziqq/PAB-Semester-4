Emerging in the early 2010s with the hit single \"The Way,\" Grande was primed to follow in the footsteps of her biggest influences, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, due in part to her powerhouse vocals. With its Babyface production, her debut, Yours Truly, underscored her debt to '90s R&B, but Grande quickly incorporated hip-hop and EDM into her sound.")
